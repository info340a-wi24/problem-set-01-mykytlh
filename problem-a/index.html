    <p> Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who 
        frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character
        with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most
        superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying
        on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. One of the most famous work of art
        where Batman appears is a trilogy of movies called 
        <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Trilogy#:~:text=The%20Dark%20Knight%20Series%20is,appeared%20in%20all%20three%20movies.">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a>
